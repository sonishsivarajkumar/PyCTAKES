## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - "Foundation Release"

PyTAKES v1.0.0 represents the first stable release of our Python-native clinical NLP framework. This release delivers comprehensive feature parity with Apache cTAKES while providing modern Python APIs and superior usability.

**Key Highlights:**
- üè• **Clinical-First Design**: Built specifically for clinical text processing with medical abbreviation awareness, section detection, and assertion analysis
- üöÄ **Multiple Pipeline Types**: Choose from default, fast, or basic pipelines based on your accuracy/speed requirements  
- üîß **Flexible Architecture**: Modular annotator system allows custom pipeline composition and easy extensibility
- üìä **Production Ready**: Comprehensive testing, error handling, and performance optimization for real-world deployment
- üìñ **Complete Documentation**: Full user guides, API documentation, and practical examples

**Migration from cTAKES:**
PyTAKES provides a drop-in replacement for Apache cTAKES with simpler deployment (no Java required) and modern NLP backends. Existing cTAKES users can migrate their pipelines using our configuration system.

**Next Steps:**
- Enhanced UMLS integration with full QuickUMLS support
- Relation extraction for temporal and dosage relationships
- REST API service wrapper
- Performance optimizations and Docker containers

**Community:**
PyTAKES is open source and welcoming contributions. Join us in advancing clinical NLP with modern Python tools!
