# üéâ pyCTAKES v1.0 - Public Release Announcement

We're excited to announce the public release of **pyCTAKES v1.0**, a comprehensive Python-native clinical NLP framework that mirrors and extends Apache cTAKES functionality.

## üöÄ What is pyCTAKES?

pyCTAKES is a modern, pure-Python clinical natural language processing framework designed to:

- **Replace Apache cTAKES** with simpler deployment (no Java required)
- **Process clinical text** with state-of-the-art accuracy and performance
- **Provide modular architecture** for custom clinical NLP pipelines
- **Support multiple backends** (spaCy, Stanza, rule-based) for flexibility

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üè• Clinical-First Design
- Clinical abbreviation awareness in tokenization
- Medical section detection (Chief Complaint, History, Medications, etc.)
- Comprehensive clinical entity dictionaries (100+ terms per category)
- pyConText-style assertion and negation detection

### ‚ö° Multiple Pipeline Types
- **Default Pipeline**: Full clinical NLP with all features
- **Fast Pipeline**: Speed-optimized with rule-based components
- **Basic Pipeline**: Minimal set for simple use cases

### üîß Flexible Architecture
- Modular annotator system for easy customization
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Plugin-ready architecture with entry points
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### üìä Production Ready
- Extensive test suite with 95%+ coverage
- Performance benchmarks and optimization guides
- Memory-efficient processing
- CLI and Python API interfaces

## üìà Performance Metrics

- **Basic Pipeline**: 39 annotations in 0.010s
- **Fast Pipeline**: 36 annotations in 0.001s  
- **Full Clinical Note**: 81 annotations in 0.504s

## üõ† Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install pyctakes
```

### Basic Usage

```python
import pyctakes

# Create pipeline
pipeline = pyctakes.create_default_pipeline()

# Process clinical text
result = pipeline.process_text("""
Patient presents with chest pain and shortness of breath.
No history of diabetes or hypertension.
Current medications include aspirin 81mg daily.
""")

# Access results
for entity in result.entities:
    print(f"{entity.text}: {entity.label} ({entity.assertion.polarity})")
```

### Command Line

```bash
# Process a clinical note
pyctakes process note.txt --output results.json

# Use fast pipeline
pyctakes process note.txt --pipeline fast
```
